Hi there! I am Wenyi Wang (王文意), a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, [**The University of Chicago**](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/). I am a member of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/), where I am advised by Prof. [Ian Foster](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/) and Prof. [Kyle Chard](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/kyle-chard/).

My core research lies at the intersection of computer systems and machine learning, centered on building fast, scalable, and efficient solutions by exploiting fine-grained parallelism. 

Currently, I am working on large-scale, efficient LLM inference on many-node HPC systems, alongside the advancement of fine-grained parallelism techniques in OpenMP tasking models.

Previously, I had the privilege of being advised by Dr. [Camilo Rojas](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/camilorq/overview/) and Prof. [Pattie Maes](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/pattie/overview/) ([**MIT Media Lab**](https://www.media.mit.edu/), [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/projects/)); Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) ([**Carnegie Mellon University**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), [Xu lab](https://xulabs.github.io/)); and Prof. [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/)([**Northwestern University**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/), [Prescience Lab](http://presciencelab.org/)).
